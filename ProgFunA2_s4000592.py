# Analysis

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Each programme component has been developed using an object-oriented paradigm, and The programme is divided into objects, each of which has its own methods and attributes.
# Access modifiers are frequently used to prevent unintended changes to object.
# Getters and setters were implemented for each object to make it easier to access object variables. 
# The inheritance is used whenever possible makes advantage of object-oriented capabilities, has reduced the amount of code.
# This feature's implementation in part 1 had a number of issues, including the inability to test the code as classes, variables, and methods wereÂ initializing. .
# Several little and significant bugs needed to be repaired.
# The first component (pass level) was simpler to manage and implement. Additionally, there were no invalid input values. 
# However, the initialisation procedure took a lot of time and work. The requirements for the credit level 
# were somewhat less convoluted, but still challenging, so I was obliged to use custom exceptions rather than while  loops to assure precise entry. 
# To get the desired outcome, I combined recursion with exception handling.
# The introduction of group tickets significantly increased the complexity of the programme and needed the creation of logic to handle such cases because one ticket could now fill more than 1 seat.
# Since I didn't know how many values would be contained in each line of the # text files, reading the group tickets from those files proved to be challenging.
# We found it easier to implement these requirements because we could always count on there being valid input. At the DI level, the requirement to accept multiple inputs was introduced. 
# Because object-oriented programmes adhere to the concept of modularity, 
# it was easier to meet the requirements because changes could be made to a specific area of the programme without running the risk of the programme crashing altogether. 
# Due to the fact that each ticket transaction will be included in a single booking, the Booking object had to be changed.
# The pass-level included the implementation of the techniques to modify the discount rates for the clients.
# Additionally, a means to retrieve client information was implemented. To correctly invoke those # methods, I just had to implement a method. 
# I had to read the booking information and preload the booking object as requested by HD.
# Reading the booking information was difficult, but applying the logic to read the group ticket information had given me a clue as to how to read an arbitrary number of comma-separated data. 
# It was simple to display all the booking details because a booking object would store all the information, including the movie and ticket details.
# In order to handle scenarios where the amount of arguments provided was incorrect and others, accepting command line arguments required a few minor tweaks to the program's initialisation phase. 
# Given that formatting data and accurately displaying them was required in the initial assignments, I strengthened my talents and was able to use string formatting  efficiently to display all the movie records.
